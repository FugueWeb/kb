## Interpol Action Streams
* https://www.interpol.int/content/download/5586/file/Summary_CYBER_Strategy_2017_01_EN%20LR.pdf

The strategy comprises five action streams, with the common goal of helping member countries to identify cyberattacks and their perpetrators: 
1. Threat assessment and analysis, trends monitoring
Detection and positive identification of cybercrime, cybercriminals and cybercrime groups through threat assessments, analysis and trends monitoring. 
2. Access to and exploitation of raw digital data
Facilitate access to data linked to cyberattacks, and the relevant tools and partners to consolidate the collection of data and enhance its exploitation.
3. e-Evidence management process
Manage digital evidence processing for the purpose of investigation and prosecution: lawful collection
of digital clues, preserving the evidence, making it intelligible and acceptable for the court system.
4. Correlation of cyber and physical information
Bridge the gap between digital traces and physical identification so as to identify the location of possible perpetrators.
5. Harmonization and interoperability
Improve operational interoperability and global coordination, and encourage legislative harmonization.
