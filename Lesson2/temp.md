My answers follow to your questions. Each one is of course a longer discussion in itself. If you want to dig deeper into each respective topic, search on the keywords. Also check out the FAQ at https://torproject.org/docs/faq. You would also benefit from getting a clear understanding between the web, the deep web, the dark web, and the dark web with hidden services. Many people (especially the media) get this wrong, and the distinction will help you understand the internet much better.

## How easy for random person to enter the DW

Since the DW uses different protocols/software to access content, a user would never randomly stumble into the DW. Having said that, there is a relatively low technical barrier to entry.

## Can there be hackers selling cyberattacks or hacking services

Definitely. The term to search here is "script kiddie", where you have an amateur hacker who knows some basics but gets his hands on a powerful "root kit" or exploit that he then uses as a blunt instrument. For a famous and recent exploit (one still in use today because people don't patch their systems), look up "Eternal Blue".

## Would someone need a special key to the DW

Cryptography and encryption is featured heavily for any anonymizing and privacy-centric system. Onion routing in particular, uses layered encryption to enable one node on the network to communicate with another without necessarily knowing utimately where a packet of data is coming from or going to.

## How does the anonymity make it challenging to detect cybercrime

Law enforcement is often focused on establishing admissible evidence that connects a given action online to human identity, and the more anonymous one is the harder this becomes. This is a highly technical subject and raises questions about civil liberties, but one method to deanonymize is to launch a "correlation attack" against a poorly configured system or a user that has otherwise revealed something unique. Basically this involves sniffing traffic at the point of origin of the data packet and at the exit nodes where the data packet may temporarily exit the anonymized network to hit a server, and then making deductions about which IP address sent/received what. Research "onion routing" and "hidden services" for more information.

## What are the rules toward going in the DW if any

The tools by which you access the DW are free and open source. Indeed, the Tor Project was originally developed by the Navy. And the Tor browser is just a modified version of Mozilla Firefox. For the most part, visiting the DW or using these types of tools is not a crime, unless the page content itself is criminal which can open many legal considerations. However visiting certain sites can certainly get you (your IP address) put on someone's radar. It's a little like a knife. Use it to cut rope and vegetables, not people. And don't blame the knife if you screw up.
