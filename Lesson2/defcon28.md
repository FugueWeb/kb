4G based IMSI catchers such as the Hailstorm are becoming more popular with governments and law enforcement around the world, as well as spies, and even criminals. Until now IMSI catcher detection has focused on 2G IMSI catchers such as the Stingray which are quickly falling out of favor.

In this talk we will tell you how 4G IMSI Catchers might work to the best of our knowledge, and what they can and can't do. We demonstrate a brand new software project to detect fake 4G base stations, with open source software and relatively cheap hardware. And finally we will present a comprehensive plan to dramatically limit the capabilities of IMSI catchers (with the long term goal of making them useless once and for all).

### DEF CON Safe Mode - Sean Metcalf - Hacking the Hybrid Cloud

Most companies have moved into the cloud and on-premises applications and systems remain. This configuration is reasonably referred to as "hybrid"; in the cloud and not at the same time. Hybrid cloud requires integration and communication between the remaining on-prem infrastructure and the new(er) cloud services.

This talk describes several scenarios that appear to subvert typical security and protections which involve federation configuration, Identity Access Management (IAM), and interaction between SaaS and IaaS in the Microsoft Cloud.
