* [Atom](https://atom.io/)
* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)

2. (Optional) Create a GitHub account - Your ticket into the open source community.

3. (Optional) [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) - Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
